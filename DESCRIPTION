Title: Work with Last.FM using R
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Jacobo Blanco
Maintainer: Jacobo Blanco <jayb88@gmail.com>
Description: Query the last.fm API from R
    This package supports a handful of the endpoints and simplifies
    working with the API in a way that is more idiomatic. You can either
    query the raw endpoints or use the "tidy" endpoints to get nicer
    dataframes.
